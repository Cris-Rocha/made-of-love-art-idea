    <p>Since always I had art pulsing on my veins, for some reason I left this forbiden on the botton of my dreams for over than decades. 
      After to understand that I am a person who needs  to breath and to have creative imputs surrounding me, I could understand better my essence and opened my mind and heart 
      to accept it and work with it.<br>
    <p> A lot of different ways brings me to this happy meeting with Web Design, as I studied Interior Designer and I am totally passionated for different colors and styles, 
      I felt kind of maybe now I am in the right way and I can put all my effort and hear doing something that I can love and work with at the same time.     </p>
    <p> One of my process of learning more about myself it was practicing art therapy,
       and drawing mandalas made me realize there's a universe of possibilities inside us. 
       I just needed to allow this to finds me and also  to be open to all the possibilities the universe can show and invite us to be try it.</p>
    <p> Starting the process of drawing and focusing on this process it was interesting, cause we can deep dive in our sould and find diferent perceptions and point of view we didnt have
      access before. And so I started explorating this feeling and have the oportunity to face the reality I was living, the routine I was doing it was not totally me and I needed
      to change this using my creativity do renew my own cirscunstances.</P>
    <P> Since 2008 I draw some mandalas in commum paper, colorating it with colored pencil and pens. 
      It was quite of a secret, as I was not used to share any of my art to none of my friend as I used to do it to relax and I didnt think this could be really some art. 
      But when I started in 2018 the art therapy, I noticed this was some energy that was living already on my inner and I should project outside, cleaning my fears, dealing with my
      feelings, expressing myself in my essence so I decided to make it in a different way, with some other kind of material, bigger and so I decided try to make
      mandalas on wood and see what could happen from there!
      Here it was the point I started using inks!</p> <!-- Escrevi ate aqui, estou mudando tudo no texto praticamente-->
    <p> I keeped the mandalas for me, for a long timeIt was my beggining and as I used tolike it so much I started sharing this with my closing friends. 
      But also I thought this could be more than a hobbie and something to fullfill my heart managing better mny emotions trought the art, 
      I realize I could sell my art because I think we are here to cooperate to a nice and colorfull world. As the internet is a 
      huge and amazing way to put all my informations together, I started sharing my art through an instagram account.</p>
    <p> I started this process during pandemic times, I am putting just in some worlds a huge process I build and I achieved until there but 
      I needed support of my friend and also in art therapy to deal with the fear of not being accepted in the art community but I needed to be brave to deal with all this deep emotions and face it to learn step by step also to heal me, So in this process, 
      I created <link rel="instagram" href="https://www.instagram.com/madeoflove.art/"> @madeoflove.art, an instagram account with my most recently arts and I am pretty happy with what do I achieved.
</p>
<p> Since I was starting the process of changing my life and come to study in Barcelona, I needed to make some choices and one of that it was the hard decision of to change my life in 180ยบ, for this, I needed to quit my job and start a mnew chapter in my story in a diferent country with a language I did'nt speak at all... In the middle of this process I understood I needed to try to change more than the country I was going to live but also to be open for the new, also trying to do something I really feel fullfilment on doing it, and in the middle of this process, I received the information about the course of desarrollador web of MigraCode, and I decided could be the oportiunity I was looking to complete the creation love combinating with technology and I really felt liike doing this.</P>

<P> I can't really say this it was very easy for me, I needed to read and study some times the information to understand well, but as more I studied, more I had the curiosity to learn and to apply every single new information brings me a sensation of doing something very important to my own life, because I feel for the first time I really can do my best doing somthing I do with love, like a tinny peace of art in each webpage...</p>
<p> I am very glad to being part  of this and started to learn from the Khan Academy and for Migracode give me the oportunituy to make part of this process, I feel like the good energy of this movement is making me going deep and determinatated to this goal</p>
