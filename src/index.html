    <p>Since always I had art pulsing on my veins, but I left this forbiden on the botton of my dreams for more than decades. After to understand I am a person who needs creativity surrounding me, I opened my mind and heart to accept it and work with it.<br>
    <p> A lot of ways bring me to this happy meeting with Web Design, as I am already an Interior Designer passionated for different colors and styles, I fell like I found something that I can love and work with at the same time.     </p>
    <p> One of my process of learning more about myself it was practicing art therapy, and drawing mandalas made me perhaps  there's a universe of possibilities inside us. We just need to allow this and also the outside possibilities will show the face for us too.</p>
    <p> Starting the process of drawing it was kind of interesting, cause when we focus in something ... lots of information will come easily until us. And so I started explorating this a little bit, in a creative way.</P>
    <P> Since 2008 I draw some mandalas in commum paper, colorating it with colored pencil and pens. It was quite of a secret, as I was not used to share this with no one as I used to do it to relax. But when I started in 2018 doing some therapy, I noticed this was some energy that lived inside me and I was projecting outside, so I decided to make it bigger and so I found a way to create this mandalas on wood and tried another techniques of painting, I started using Inks here!</p>
    <p> I keeped the mandalas for me, for a long timeIt was my beggining and as I used tolike it so much I started sharing this with my closing friends. But also I thought this could be more than a hobbie and something to fullfill my heart managing better mny emotions trought the art, I realize I could sell my art because I think we are here to cooperate to a nice and colorfull world. As the internet is a huge and amazing way to put all my informations together, I started sharing my art through an instagram account.</p>
    <p> I started this process during pandemic times, I am putting just in some worlds a huge process I build and I achieved until there but I needed support of my friend and also in art therapy to deal with the fear of not being accepted in the art community but I needed to be brave to deal with all this deep emotions and face it to learn step by step also to heal me, So in this process, I created @madeoflove.art , an instagram account with my most recently arts and I am pretty happy with what do I achieved.
</p>
<p> Since I was starting the process of changing my life and come to study in Barcelona, I needed to make some choices and one of that it was the hard decision of to change my life in 180ยบ, for this, I needed to quit my job and start a mnew chapter in my story in a diferent country with a language I did'nt speak at all... In the middle of this process I understood I needed to try to change more than the country I was going to live but also to be open for the new, also trying to do something I really feel fullfilment on doing it, and in the middle of this process, I received the information about the course of desarrollador web of MigraCode, and I decided could be the oportiunity I was looking to complete the creation love combinating with technology and I really felt liike doing this.</P>

<P> I can't really say this it was very easy for me, I needed to read and study some times the information to understand well, but as more I studied, more I had the curiosity to learn and to apply every single new information brings me a sensation of doing something very important to my own life, because I feel for the first time I really can do my best doing somthing I do with love, like a tinny peace of art in each webpage...</p>
<p> I am very glad to being part  of this and started to learn from the Khan Academy and for Migracode give me the oportunituy to make part of this process, I feel like the good energy of this movement is making me going deep and determinatated to this goal</p>
